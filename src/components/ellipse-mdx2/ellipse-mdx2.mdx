- ðŸ”´ Self-hosting is the hardest to set upâ€”you would usually need an experienced person to manage this. Cloud services are almost never free, and setting up an on-site server and connecting it to the WAN can be even more costly.
- ðŸŸ¢ Jamstack providers can help you set up a working website in almost no time and offers features like server-side redirects that are easily configurable. Many providers offer generous build time quotas even for free plans that you would almost never exceed. However, it's still ultimately limitedâ€”you would need to pay once you hit the limit. Check the pricing page of your provider for details.

However, this service (including build and deployment) is always free for public repositories, and we have detailed instructions to help you make it work.
